## Introduction

This space serves as a collective working space for E3SM AI Group.
We share docs, scripts, examples, and prototypes for E3SM AI efforts.

!!! tip "Did you know?"
    We also share our meeting notes internally on Confluence!

## Getting Started

To access our workflows and examples, click on the **Workflows** tab at the top of the page. There you will find:

- **ACE2-ERA5 Training Workflow** - Complete guide for training the ACE (AI2 Climate Emulator) model using the ACE2-ERA5 dataset on GPU compute nodes.

- **SCREAM v1 Data Generation Example** - An example to generate SCREAM v1 data on the fly to train ACE2, without the need for post-processing or outputing expensive 3D variables.
